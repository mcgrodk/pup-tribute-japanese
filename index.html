        <h2>A Morbid Timeline:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2010</strong> - PUP (originally named Topanga) forms in Toronto, Ontario, Canada with a lineup of Stefan Babcock (lead vocals, guitar), Steve Sladkowski (guitar), Nestor Chumak (bass), and Zack Mykula (drums).</li>
          <li><strong>Dec 2010</strong> - PUP (as Topanga) releases a 4-track EP for free digital download.
          <li><strong>Sept 2013</strong> - PUP’s music video debut “Reservoir” is uploaded to YouTube, depicting the chaotic lifestyle of a touring band.         </li>
          <li><strong>Dec 2013</strong> - PUP self-releases their debut album <em>PUP</em>, later reissued in the United States in 2014 on SideOneDummy records.</li>
          <li><strong>Dec 2015</strong> - Babcock has difficulty maintaining his voice on PUP's year-round touring schedule, but continues playing shows against doctor's orders. The band is forced to cancel the remainder of a tour when Babcock loses his voice completely. A doctor examines his damaged vocal cords and tells him, “The dream is over.”</li>
          <li><strong>Feb-Mar 2016</strong> - PUP debuts music videos for the songs “If This Tour Doesn’t Kill You, I Will” and “DVP” on YouTube to promote their second album.</li>
          <li><strong>May 2016</strong> - PUP releases their second album <em>The Dream is Over</em>, named in reference to the health scare from which Babcock makes a full recovery.</li>
          <li><strong>Jul-Dec 2016</strong> - <em>The Dream is Over</em> achieves critical and commercial success. The album receives a nomination for the Canadian Polaris Music Prize, and the video for "Sleep in the Heat" earns a mention in Rolling Stone's "Best Music Videos of 2016."</li>

          <li><strong>Mar 2019</strong> - PUP’s third album <em>Morbid Stuff</em> is released on Little Dipper Records. Album pre-orders are shipped with an eccentric line of band merch including PUP backpacks, emergency kits and inflatable lifeboats.</li>
